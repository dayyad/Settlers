# Settlers

An early attempt to build a game with networking functionality that resembles the classic "Settlers of Catan" board game. 

## What is Settlers? 


In the original board game, Settlers of Catan, 2 or more players compete by gathering resources on the board by building around various tiles. A player can win the game by collecting victory points.

This project was a way for me to try and recreate something I really like playing the physical version of. 


### Dependancies
The only Lib required for running this is the ecs100 library by Victoria University of Wellington. It is bundles into the repo.
